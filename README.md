# bible-Taboo

## This is an online taboo game using bible related characters, places, etc.

### How to Install

### How to Run

### Issues

- Currently the game mostly works how I want it to.
- However, I feel like the code could be optimised or things could be done simpler.
- I have been using React for about 6 months, though I read as much articles as I can this is code displays my level of understanding
- I would appreciate if someone can take a look and give me some tips on UI/UX, firebase, architechture, etc.
